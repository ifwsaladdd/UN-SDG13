<h1 id="e-waste-management-in-india">E-Waste Management in India</h1>
<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Electronic waste (e-waste) represents one of the fastest-growing
waste streams globally, and India ranks as the third-largest generator
of e-waste worldwide. This report examines the critical importance of
e-waste management, analyzes India’s existing legal framework, and
evaluates implementation measures across Indian cities and towns.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="waste-management-importance-and-impact">Waste Management:
Importance and Impact</h2>
<p>### Understanding E-Waste: 1. E-waste, or Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment (WEEE), refers to electrical and electronic
equipment that has reached the end of its useful life and is discarded
by consumers. According to the E-waste (Management) Rules of 2016 issued
by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), e-waste is defined as
electrical and electronic equipment, whole or in part, discarded as
waste by consumers (individual or bulk) as well as rejects from
manufacturing, refurbishment and repair processes.</p>
<pre><code>The equipment encompasses a wide range of products categorized into two broad segments:
1. Information Technology and Communication Equipment (ITEW): Including computers, laptops, mobile phones, printers, and telecommunication devices
2. Consumer Electrical and Electronics (CEEW): Including televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, and fluorescent lamps</code></pre>
<h3 id="composition-and-value-of-e-wastes">Composition and Value of
E-Wastes</h3>
<p>E-waste comprises multiple components: glass waste accounts for 37
percent (the highest proportion), metallic waste accounts for 33
percent, and plastic waste accounts for 30 percent. Within the metallic
fraction, iron constitutes 52 percent, copper 18 percent, aluminum 12
percent, lead 3 percent, zinc 3 percent, and others 12 percent. This
composition reveals a critical paradox: e-waste contains valuable metals
such as gold, silver, platinum, palladium, nickel and copper, alongside
hazardous materials. This dual nature makes e-waste both an economic
opportunity and an environmental challenge.</p>
<h3 id="scale-of-e-wastes-generation-in-india">Scale of E-Wastes
Generation In India</h3>
<p>India’s e-waste generation has grown exponentially due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Increased affordability and penetration of electronic
devices</p></li>
<li><p>Rapid technological advancements leading to shorter product
lifecycles</p></li>
<li><p>Growing middle-class consumption patterns</p></li>
<li><p>Expanding digital infrastructure</p></li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Global E-waste Monitor 2020, India generated 3.2
million metric tonnes (mMT) of e-waste in 2019. The generation has been
growing at approximately 13 percent annually.</p>
<p>However, CPCB estimated that only 771,215 tonnes (0.77 mMT) of
e-waste was generated in 2018-19, based on sales data of 1,168 producers
registered with it, which does not include imported e-waste figures.</p>
<p><strong>Projected Growth:</strong> If we extrapolate based on a 13
percent growth rate, by 2025, India will be producing 7 mMT of e-waste
annually, which will increase to over 160 mMT by 2050.</p>
<p><strong>State-wise Distribution</strong>: The top e-waste generating
states include Maharashtra (13.9%), Tamil Nadu (9.1%), Andhra Pradesh
(8.7%), Uttar Pradesh (7.1%), West Bengal (6.9%), Delhi (6.7%),
Karnataka (6.2%), Gujarat (6.1%), and Madhya Pradesh (5.3%).</p>

<h3 id="environmental-and-health-impacts">Environmental and Health
Impacts</h3>
<p><strong>Environmental Concerns</strong></p>
<p>E-waste contains hazardous substances such as <strong>Cathode Ray
Tubes</strong> consisting of lead oxide, Lead, Mercury, Tin and other
harmful metals which, if landfilled, can induce toxicity in groundwater
and soil. The air and soil pollution caused due to unsafe practices and
dumping of hazardous parts of WEEE in landfills are grave environmental
concerns. Since e-waste contains a significant amount of hazardous and
toxic substances, even a small volume of e-waste entering other waste
streams releases toxic and halogenated substances. According to a plea
submitted to the National Green Tribunal in July 2018, electronic waste
accounted for 40% of lead and 70% of heavy metals found in
landfills.</p>
<h3 id="economic-implications">Economic Implications</h3>
<p>There is a strong economic case for better e-waste management in
cities, from a perspective of rare earth materials and revenue
proposition for cities. Recycled metals are also 2 to 10 times more
energy-efficient than metals smelted from virgin ore. According to the
Global E-Waste Monitor 2020, the estimated value of recoverable
materials from e-waste generated in 2019 was approximately 57 billion
USD. Despite this value, in 2016-17, India treated only 0.036 MT of its
e-waste, while e-waste is growing at a compound annual growth rate
(CAGR) of about 30 percent in the country.</p>
