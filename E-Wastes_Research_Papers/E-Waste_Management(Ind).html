<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Electronic waste (e-waste) represents one of the fastest-growing waste streams globally, and India ranks as the third-largest generator of e-waste worldwide. This report examines the critical importance of e-waste management, analyzes India’s existing legal framework, and evaluates implementation measures across Indian cities and towns.</p>

<h2>Waste Management: Importance and Impact</h2>
<h3>Understanding E-Waste:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>E-waste, or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), refers to electrical and electronic equipment that has reached the end of its useful life and is discarded by consumers. According to the E-waste (Management) Rules of 2016 issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), e-waste is defined as electrical and electronic equipment, whole or in part, discarded as waste by consumers (individual or bulk) as well as rejects from manufacturing, refurbishment and repair processes.</p>
<p>The equipment encompasses a wide range of products categorized into two broad segments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information Technology and Communication Equipment (ITEW): Including computers, laptops, mobile phones, printers, and telecommunication devices</li>
<li>Consumer Electrical and Electronics (CEEW): Including televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, and fluorescent lamps</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Composition and Value of E-Wastes</h3>
<p>E-waste comprises multiple components: glass waste accounts for 37 percent (the highest proportion), metallic waste accounts for 33 percent, and plastic waste accounts for 30 percent. Within the metallic fraction, iron constitutes 52 percent, copper 18 percent, aluminum 12 percent, lead 3 percent, zinc 3 percent, and others 12 percent.
This composition reveals a critical paradox: e-waste contains valuable metals such as gold, silver, platinum, palladium, nickel and copper, alongside hazardous materials. This dual nature makes e-waste both an economic opportunity and an environmental challenge.</p>
<h3>Scale of E-Wastes Generation In India</h3>
<p>India’s e-waste generation has grown exponentially due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increased affordability and penetration of electronic devices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rapid technological advancements leading to shorter product lifecycles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Growing middle-class consumption patterns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expanding digital infrastructure</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Global E-waste Monitor 2020, India generated 3.2 million metric tonnes (mMT) of e-waste in 2019. The generation has been growing at approximately 13 percent annually.</p>
<p>However, CPCB estimated that only 771,215 tonnes (0.77 mMT) of e-waste was generated in 2018-19, based on sales data of 1,168 producers registered with it, which does not include imported e-waste figures.</p>
<p><strong>Projected Growth:</strong> If we extrapolate based on a 13 percent growth rate, by 2025, India will be producing 7 mMT of e-waste annually, which will increase to over 160 mMT by 2050.</p>
<p><strong>State-wise Distribution</strong>: The top e-waste generating states include Maharashtra (13.9%), Tamil Nadu (9.1%), Andhra Pradesh (8.7%), Uttar Pradesh (7.1%), West Bengal (6.9%), Delhi (6.7%), Karnataka (6.2%), Gujarat (6.1%), and Madhya Pradesh (5.3%).</p>
