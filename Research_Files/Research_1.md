# SDG 12
- #### Main goal: Responsible Consumption and Production 

---

Goal 12 is about ensuring sustainable consumption 	and production patterns, which is key to sustain the livelihoods of current and future generations. 

* Key issue: **unsustainable consumption and production patterns that deplete resources and harm the environment.**

---

The planet's resources are depleting at an alarming rate alongside the geometrical progession of the planet's population which has skyrocketed in the recent decades. 

As of 2024, 530 policies related to sustainable consumption and production were submitted across 71 countries, a 6 per cent increase from 2023. 

Global fossil fuel subsidies fell by 34.5 per cent in 2023 â€“ from a record high of $1.68 trillion in 2022 to an estimated $1.10 trillion. Despite the drop, fossil fuel subsidies remain nearly three times 2020 levels and well above historical averages. Fossil fuel subsidies are widely recognized as inefficient, distorting prices and consumption while diverting public funds from sustainable development.

Food waste is another sign of over consumption, and tackling food loss is urgent and requires dedicated policies, informed by data, as well as investments in technologies, infrastructure, education and monitoring. A staggering 931 million tons of food is wasted a year, despite a huge number of the global population going hungry.

Economic and social progress over the last century has been accompanied by environmental degradation that is endangering the very systems on which our future development and very survival depend.


* ### Role of the Government: 
	- #### Implement and enforce policies and regulations that include measures such as setting targets for reducing waste generation, promoting circular economy practices, and supporting sustainable procurement policies
	#### 
		Circular Economy:an economic system based on the reuse and regeneration of materials or products, especially as a means of continuing production in a sustainable or environmentally friendly way.


* Transitioning to a circular economy involves designing products for longevity, repairability, and recyclability. It also involves promoting practices such as reusing, refurbishing, and recycling products to minimize waste and resource depletion.

#### Transitioning into a circular economy aids in reduced wastes, lower greenhouse gas emissions and conservation of natural resources, leading to increase in biodiversity and less pollution.
